## Streams

| Stream | Theme | Issues | Note |
|--------|-------|--------|------|
| A | Core trade | #2 → #3 | North star; everything depends on S-01 |
| B | Portfolio views | #4, #5, #6 | Parallel after S-01 |
| C | Additional operations | #7, #8 | DEPOSIT + WITHDRAW after S-01 |
| D | Sell-all | #9 → #10 | Single-location then global |

## Labels

| Label | Color | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `foundation` | grey | Cross-cutting prerequisite (F-NN) |
| `slice` | blue | Vertical user-visible slice (S-NN) |
| `north-star` | yellow | Validation milestone |
| `question` | orange | Decision needed before implementation |
| `research` | green | Spike / investigation needed |
| `ready` | green | Prerequisites met, ready for `/10x-plan` |
| `proposed` | light grey | Sequenced but prerequisites not yet met |

## How to use

- **Start planning:** pick a `ready` issue (currently #2) and run `/10x-plan <change-id>`
- **After completing a foundation:** close its GitHub issue, flip its Linear status to Done, and update downstream issues from `proposed` to `ready`
- **Questions / Research:** resolve Q/R issues before the roadmap items they block; document findings in the issue thread
- **Sync:** this file is a snapshot; GitHub and Linear are the live sources of truth
